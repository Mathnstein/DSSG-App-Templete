# DSSG Dashboard Template

Here is a demo shiny app to be used for the 2018 DSSG education group. This app is intended to display geospatial data about the city of Surrey, all of which is open source from UBC HELP's [website](http://earlylearning.ubc.ca/maps/edi/sd/36/). This is intended to be a starting point for the other DSSG groups in their own app development and will allow for smoother merging in the end if allowed.

The [ui.R](https://github.com/Mathnstein/DSSG-APP-Templete/blob/master/ui.R) and [server.R](https://github.com/Mathnstein/DSSG-APP-Templete/blob/master/server.R) files are needed together to run the app and the data folder contains all the open source EDI and shape files required to run the app effectively.
